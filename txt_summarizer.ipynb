Keepers at the Kamala Nehru zoo in Indore, Hyderabad, went to check on two-year-old tiger Rajan in his enclosure on Saturday morning. The tiger had been brought to the zoo just a month ago as part of a breeding programme for the rare animals. Scroll down for video . Rare white tiger Rajan, who was discovered unconscious in its cage at Kamala Nehru zoo in India after being bitten by a venomous cobra . But when zookeepers opened the door, they found the tiger unconscious, and bleeding from the nose and foaming at the mouth. Vets were called but they were unable to save the big cat, who was declared dead, with a post mortem examination revealing a poisonous snake bite as a cause of death. Now zoo officials believe that the cobra somehow found its way into the tiger's enclosure and the two animals began to fight. The snake then bit the tiger unleashing its venom, which killed the rare animal. Vets battled to save the two-year-old big cat, pictured, who had only been at the zoo for just over a month, but he unfortunately died . However, the cobra was also injured in the clash and has been left paralysed with animal experts battling to save it. Uttam Yadav, the zoo's director, told the Hindustan Times: 'It appears that the tiger had a fight with the snake and died after the snake bit the big cat. 'We found an injured cobra inside of the tiger's cage. When we checked on the tiger it was unconscious. I assume the tiger and cobra had a fight in which the cobra would have bitten and killed the tiger.' Now the zoo are putting measures in place to make sure snakes are unable to enter the tiger enclosure. Dr Yadav added: 'As part of precautionary measures, the authority will put thin wire mesh across all the cages, build trenches and put board at some part of cages to block the entry of crawling animals inside the cages.' The black cobra, which had fought with the tiger and unleashed its venomous bite, which ultimately killed the big cat . The Indore zoo now only have three white tigresses called Diya, Shivani and Sita. The park has more than 65 cages and as many as 452 different animals and is one of the most visited attractions in in Hyderabad. The tiger's death comes after a man was killed by a white tiger after allegedly jumping into its moat at another Indian zoo. The man, named locally as Maqsood, is said to have been under the influence of alcohol when he climbed into the white tiger enclosure at New Delhi Zoo in September. Witnesses say the 22-year-old entered the enclosure despite several attempts by zoo security to keep him from the tigers.\",\n          \"CIA manuals\\u00a0offering tips to help spies maintain their cover while using false documents as they crossed international borders have been released by Wikleaks. The two documents, dating from 2011 and 2012, are marked classified and 'NOFORN,' which means they were not meant to be shared with allied intelligence agencies, WikiLeaks said. The documents outline a number of strategies for agents to avoid secondary screening at airports and borders. CIA manuals offering tips to help spies maintain their cover while using false documents as they crossed international borders have been released by Wikleaks . Some are obvious - \\u00a0don't buy a one-way ticket with cash the day before flying, although others are less so - don't look scruffy while traveling on a diplomatic passport. The manual states: 'Mental preparation almost certainly helps travelers pass secondary scrutiny.' The guide states that travelers who attract attention and appear suspicious qualify sentence meanings with 'words like \\u201ctypically,\\u201d \\u201cnormally,\\u201d \\u201coften,\\u201d \\u201cmaybe,\\u201d or \\u201calmost\\u201d or phrases like \\u201cto be honest,\\u201d \\u201cthe truth is,\\u201d or \\u201cswear to God.' There is a section devoted to baggage and lists reasons for detection including: . \\u2022 Baggage or contents inconsistent with the passenger's appearance, profession, or ticket class . \\u2022 An unexplained lack of baggage probably would raise suspicions. \\u2022 Multiple new items, such as alarm clocks or notebooks, in baggage. \\u2022 Carelessly packed baggage when passenger is purportedly an experienced business traveler. \\u2022 Unopened and unmarked maps, guidebooks, or other literature. \\u2022 Maps of unrelated cities in baggage for a purported tourist traveler. \\u2022 Camera quality not matching the traveler's profile or camera memory card insufficient for a lengthy tourist trip. The documents outline a number of strategies for agents to avoid secondary screening at airports and borders . The guide lists countries which look for certain types of travelers - for example it states Japanese customs officials pay attention to single, Western travelers \\u00a0'because they may be drug couriers.' Similarly it states that in Tel Aviv, officials are on the look-out for 'military-aged males traveling alone with backpacks... regardless of their nationality or skin color. In one incident during transit of a European airport in the early morning, security officials selected a CIA officer for secondary screening,' one of the documents reads. 'Although the officials gave no reason, overly casual dress inconsistent with being a diplomatic-passport holder may have prompted the referral.' The CIA agent involved went on to have his bag swabbed for explosives and it tested positive. Despite extensive questioning, he stuck to his cover story that he had been involved in counterterrorism training in the United States, and eventually was allowed to continue his journey. 'Consistent, well-rehearsed, and plausible cover is important for avoiding secondary selection and critical for surviving it,' the CIA wrote. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in a statement: 'The CIA has carried out kidnappings from European Union states, including Italy and Sweden, during the Bush administration' In a statement, WikiLeaks said this example 'begs the question: if the training that supposedly explained the explosives was only a cover story, what was a CIA officer really doing passing through (a European Union) airport with traces of explosives on him, and why was he allowed to continue?' One of the CIA documents, called 'Schengen Overview,' reveals that the CIA is very concerned about EU nations introducing biometric security measures for people traveling on US passports and that new systems pose an increased 'identity threat' - in other words, making it harder for agents to travel on false documents. The document focuses on the EU's Schengen area, a chunk of Europe in which travelers between 22 EU countries are no longer required to show passports. The CIA expressed concerns that a new EU security system will potentially make life harder for CIA agents. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in a statement: 'The CIA has carried out kidnappings from European Union states, including Italy and Sweden, during the Bush administration. These manuals show that under the Obama administration the CIA is still intent on infiltrating European Union borders and conducting clandestine operations in EU member states.' Sunday's release is the second in a series of CIA releases from WikiLeaks.\",\n          \"New York (CNN) -- Competitive eater Joey \\\"Jaws\\\" Chestnut proved himself the official top dog of the hot dog-eating world when he ate 62 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes at the annual Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest on Monday, but his archnemesis Takeru Kobayashi crushed Chestnut's world record at an off-site event where he pounded down 69 hot dogs and buns. For the fifth year in a row, Chestnut beat the 17-man field at the 96th annual Major League Eating event at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York. Kobayashi, who has been banned from the contest due to a contract dispute with Major League Eating, competed from afar: on the roof of a Manhattan bar, in unison with Chestnut and his fellow competitors. Kobayashi polished off 69 hot dogs and buns to the tune of a crowd chanting \\\"Kobi! Kobi!\\\" and the official Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest playing on a television beside him. He beat Chestnut's 2009 world record of 68 hot dogs and buns. But Chestnut brushed off the feat since Kobayashi was miles away from the cheering crowds in Brooklyn. \\\"It wasn't a competition,\\\" he said. \\\"It was no different than what I do at practice on my own and I'm able to break a record at my house,\\\" Chestnut added. Event organizers agree, arguing that the record is not official if it's not broken at Coney Island. \\\"I don't know if it was a magic show or an eating contest,\\\" said Richard Shea, president of Major League Eating. \\\"Not having been there, it seems like a bit of a farce. The hot dog eating contest is on Coney Island.\\\" Major League Eating will not recognize Kobayashi's 69 hot dogs as a new world record, Shea said. Kobayashi, who gained 18 pounds during the contest, said his makeshift competition was to remind the world \\\"that I'm still good, that I'm still in the contest,\\\" he said through an interpreter. \\\"During practice, I had already broken the record, so I had enough confidence that I could beat that,\\\" he added. Kobayashi took home six consecutive Nathan's contest titles from 2001 to 2006. Last year, he was arrested after rushing the stage at the Coney Island event. But Chestnut remains the official champion, and he will share his official title with Sonya \\\"The Black Widow\\\" Thomas, who devoured 40 hot dogs and buns to beat eight other eaters in the first women's Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest. Thomas missed her own personal record by just one hot dog. Event organizers split the contest into female and male competitions this year to give the ever-expanding female field of competitors a chance at the big prize. Both Chestnut and Thomas were awarded $10,000. Chestnut took home the contest's signature Mustard belt -- a yellow championship belt -- while Thomas was the first recipient of a pink belt, meant to promote event sponsor Pepto Bismol.\"\n
